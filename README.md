Goal: Refamiliarizing with different data science and ML concepts
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file

For this project, my goal was to apply my understanding of ML concepts. It has been awhile since I have actually coded these concepts since I have been mastering the mathematics and logic behind the algorithms. I will be updating the read me with my thought process as I continue the process.

Current thought train:
My initial thoughts about this problem are what are my limiting factors? I am given a lot of good informaiton like age, sex, class,etc, but despite that there are so many unknowns. I'm going to think on this aspect especially the the correlation between class and surival rate. I'm curious how gender and class can factor into one's survival rate. Will all children have an equal chance at suriving? Were woman and children prioritized or young parents and children?
